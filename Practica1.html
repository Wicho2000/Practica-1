		     		<p>Guts, renowned as the <i>"Black Swordsman"</i>, is a former mercenary and branded wanderer who travels the world in a constant internal struggle between pursuing his own ends and upholding his attachments to those dear to him.</p>

		     		<p>At one time driven solely by his will to survive, <b>Guts</b> finds purpose in life upon joining the Band of the Falcon, greatly helping in the faction's storied successes during the Hundred-Year War as captain of the band's raiders. He eventually becomes dissatisfied with clinging to Griffith's dream and departs from the band in pursuit of his own. Following the horrors of the <b>Eclipse</b> prompted by Griffith, Guts embarks on a two-year war against the God Hand and apostles, becoming increasingly embittered on his one-track quest for retribution. He in time realizes protecting his regressed lover is more important to him, as well as something he cannot do alone, and thus puts aside his quest for revenge while fostering camaraderie with new companions.</p>

		     		 My brother, come join me
		             In battle we are stronger
		             When Tudor will falter
		             Sacrificed to their altar.
		 
		             One hundred years of wait is over
		             Now we claim what is rightful to us.
		 
		             My brother, come join me
		             In battle we are stronger
		             When Tudor will falter
		             Sacrificed to their altar.
		 
		             Oh my brother, with your courage we can conquer,
		             In your sword I put my trust that you will honor
		             I will be the higher ground should you concede it
		             And my body be your shield if you should need it.
